            This week we did a lot of setting up our website and now we're actually coding! I coded in html a long time 
            ago and this has been a good refresher. We also learned some safety as well as the engineering process. Today 
            specifically, we got to do a challenge where we had to take a marble from one point to another without it dropping on 
            the floor, the only problem was that we didn't have enough track. So, our team came up with the plan that right after 
            the marble traveled off our track, we'd run to the other end and give it to a person without a piece of track. We found
            that that strategy worked quite well, but we needed practice with it because people were holding it too steep and it
            sped up the marble to fast and it was uncontrollable. As a team, we managed to get the marble to the point we wanted it
            to get to a total of four times! :)

            This week we learned a lot about Mechanical Engineering. Some stuff we learned is how
            broad of a subject mechanical engineering is, it deals with physics, math, bioengineering, material science, 
            and much more. We also learned about some safety rules that we have to follow in class, such as keeping long 
            hair tied up when working on things and also to be responsible with knives when we're using them. Today, we 
            took a quiz on the engineering process as well as the information about safety, I think I did really well on 
            that. We also got to do an engineering challenge which was to CAD a home appliance that we can find around 
            almost every house.

            This week we finalized our Rube Goldberg machine and started to build our contraption. At first, we built it
            way out of proportion making it very small, but after a while we got it to be the correct size in tinker cad.
            Today Keira and I put the piece measurments from the tinker cad onto a piece of paper so we knew exactly what
            to build and we didn't have to go back and double check the measurments. Once we were done with that, Keira and
            I handed over the measurments to Diego and Dickson to cut into final pieces. Diego did the cutting but Dickson
            was just playing with the baseball. We got seven pieces cut today which ticks off one bullet point on our list
            of things to cut.

            This week we finished cutting everything out of the cardboard. Every piece was cut in a day and it was very fun
            to do. Once we had cut everything, we taped it all together and periodically checked if it worked with the ball
            rolling through it. We got it all together and we tried it without the balloon and it worked! Then, after waiting
            for a long time to get a balloon, a pin, and the car and baseball, we tried it out in the first test of it ever.
            The first time that we did it, it did not pop the balloon but we made some repairs to try it out again. After the
            repairs we tried it out again, and this time,
