            This week we did a lot of setting up our website and now we're actually coding! I coded in html a long time 
            ago and this has been a good refresher. We also learned some safety as well as the engineering process. Today 
            specifically, we got to do a challenge where we had to take a marble from one point to another without it dropping on 
            the floor, the only problem was that we didn't have enough track. So, our team came up with the plan that right after 
            the marble traveled off our track, we'd run to the other end and give it to a person without a piece of track. We found
            that that strategy worked quite well, but we needed practice with it because people were holding it too steep and it
            sped up the marble to fast and it was uncontrollable. As a team, we managed to get the marble to the point we wanted it
            to get to a total of four times! :)

            This week we learned a lot about Mechanical Engineering. Some stuff we learned is how
            broad of a subject mechanical engineering is, it deals with physics, math, bioengineering, material science, 
            and much more. We also learned about some safety rules that we have to follow in class, such as keeping long 
            hair tied up when working on things and also to be responsible with knives when we're using them. Today, we 
            took a quiz on the engineering process as well as the information about safety, I think I did really well on 
            that. We also got to do an engineering challenge which was to CAD a home appliance that we can find around 
            almost every house.

            This week we finalized our Rube Goldberg machine and started to build our contraption. At first, we built it
            way out of proportion making it very small, but after a while we got it to be the correct size in tinker cad.
            Today Keira and I put the piece measurments from the tinker cad onto a piece of paper so we knew exactly what
            to build and we didn't have to go back and double check the measurments. Once we were done with that, Keira and
            I handed over the measurments to Diego and Dickson to cut into final pieces. Diego did the cutting but Dickson
            was just playing with the baseball. We got seven pieces cut today which ticks off one bullet point on our list
            of things to cut.

            This week we finished cutting everything out of the cardboard. Every piece was cut in a day and it was very fun
            to do. Once we had cut everything, we taped it all together and periodically checked if it worked with the ball
            rolling through it. We got it all together and we tried it without the balloon and it worked! Then, after waiting
            for a long time to get a balloon, a pin, and the car and baseball, we tried it out in the first test of it ever.
            The first time that we did it, it did not pop the balloon but we made some repairs to try it out again. After the
            repairs we tried it out again, and this time, it popped the balloon!! I had to cut some off of the end because I 
            got too excited and made the camera go crazy. :P

        <p><br>
            This week we did two engineering challenges that were both really
            fun. The first was we had to make a boat out of one piece of 
            8 1/2" x 11" paper using only scissors and tape. I eneded up making
            what looked like a box and it stayed afloat with 24g on it for
            the full 5 minutes. The second was we had to write the measurments
            down for a uppercase, bubble letter E. The one that I got was not
            very good and only had four measurements on it so it didn't come out
            looking like an actual E. On Thursday we took notes on Computer Engineering
            and learned how it was a mix of computer science and electrical engineering.

            On Monday we learned more about Computer Engineering and what it
            entails. On Tuesday, we got to dissect a computer and see what
            everything looks like physically. Once we dissected it, we put
            everything back into the place it's supposed to be in and then
            we plugged it into power to see if it would turn on. After a
            couple seconds, it turned back on! Today, Thursday, we got to
            color the parts of a computer and the turn it into google
            classroom. We also took a test on Computer Engineering which
            I think I did very well on.

            On Monday we went over biomechanical engineering as a class. On 
            Tuesday, we built a prosthetic hand out of cardboard, string, and tape 
            Keira and I's design worked very well thanks to the tape on the end of
            the fingers. Today we started to fill out a worksheet for the slides
            and we also did our engineering challenge. Mine was a prosthetic leg 
            for a Puffin, which is my favorite animal. I think it turned out quite 
            well. (:

            On Monday, we took a quiz on Bioengineering and learned a lot about
            Aerospace Engineering which is what I want to do with my future.
            I think that it is very fun getting to desing rockets and spacecrafts
            that get to go into space and maybe even out of our solar system. On
            Thursday, we got to TinkerCad out our designs for the rocket that we
            are going to build. Mine is a pretty standard rocket with tilted vertical
            stabilizers to give the rocket some spin. Lastly, I figured out how I can
            can make the height of my nosecone for my rocket!! (the diameter is hard)
            I found that the radius of the circle that I make the cone out of is the 
            slant height and I can use that to find the actual height.

        <p>
            This week we built our design on Tuesday and the building process
            went pretty well for me and Eric, but I forgot to make the vertical
            stabilizers tilted. Today, Thursday, we got to launch our rockets
            and see how far they would go! We decided to go with a good amount
            of water based off of the other teams that went before us, then we
            thought that the highest psi we could do would be the best, that was
            75psi. As you can see in the video, it started to spin almost immediately
            and didn't go as straight as we would've liked. I think that was because
            some of the vertical stabilizers were a little tilted from something which
            might have messed up the aerodynamics of the craft. Another possible cause
            could be that when released, it was pulled to a side and that's what
            caused the spin to happen. Overall, it was just a really fun activity
            and I really liked every aspect of it.

        <p>
            This week we built a water filter and ours didn't work that well.
            Our solution was having the big rocks on the bottom, cottonballs
            on top of that, sand, and then finally pabbles. This gave a very
            dirty result which we were not that happy with. I think that we 
            could have done the smallest things on the bottom, and work our way
            up to the biggest on the top. For example, the cottonballs on the 
            very bottom, then the sand, then pebbles, and the big rocks on the
            top. I learned that the environmental engineers help reduce noise 
            and light polution along with air polution, which I thought they
            only helped with.

            This week we learned about Electrical Engineering, which is what
            I want to do in my future. I knew most of the stuff from my Physics
            class that I took last year but it was good review. Right now I am 
            having a lot of fun using TinkerCad's circuit ability. We had to light
            up a bunch of LEDs and I figured out how to do it pretty fast. We will
            be working with tangible circuits next week which I am looking
            forward to.

            This week we turned our designs on TinkerCad into a physical circuit.
            Me and my partner worked very quick and got the first lab done very
            fast. After that, we went on to the second lab and did those pretty 
            quick as well. The fourth lab though, was quite tricky, but it was
            only because the arduino was not working correctly. After we got a 
            working arduino, we did the first part of the fourth lab quickly as 
            well. But then the new arduino was not working, and we found out that
            it was because there was code already in it that we could not
            overwrite for some reason. Hopefully we can figure that out next week
            and get back on our way!

            This week we finished up our electical labs, which were very
            fun. We also started to learn about business engineering which is a 
            blend of engineering with business knowledge to make things as 
            good as possible for the customer. We learned the difference between
            a copyright, which is tangible, and an intellectual property, which is intangible. 
            I also learned about a disturbing fact that Tesla, while deciding 
            what the auto pilot would do when the car is out of contol, elected
            to hit 5 kindergarteners instead of hitting a brick wall; which to me 
            is absolute insanity. Lastly, I also learned that I do a little bit of 
            business engineering when doing robotics, we have a Kanban Board that we 
            use to keep track of what has been done and what needs to be done. We 
            brainstormed today about a product that we can pitch to investors and 
            currently we have three ideas but we don't think that they will be 
            convincing enough to actually get an investor to give us money. We will 
            have to think of more things over Thanksgiving Break.

            This week we decided on our product that we would present to the class 
            called "Scrub Doggy". It's a high tech two in one scrubber and toothbrush
            for your fluffy friend. We made all of the slides on Monday and perfected
            them on Tuesday right before we presented. We got a few questions but we
            could answer them with confidence. My favorite pitch was the pitch for the 
            prize trash can because it helps the environment while also giving people 
            a reason to go out of their way to throw away trash. We also took our Business Engineering
            Quiz today and I think that I did very well, there was only one question
            that I didn't know the full answer. We are also going to start on Civil
            Engineering today and then start building spaghetti bridges on Monday which
            I am very excited for.
