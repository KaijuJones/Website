            This week we did a lot of setting up our website and now we're actually coding! I coded in html a long time 
            ago and this has been a good refresher. We also learned some safety as well as the engineering process. Today 
            specifically, we got to do a challenge where we had to take a marble from one point to another without it dropping on 
            the floor, the only problem was that we didn't have enough track. So, our team came up with the plan that right after 
            the marble traveled off our track, we'd run to the other end and give it to a person without a piece of track. We found
            that that strategy worked quite well, but we needed practice with it because people were holding it too steep and it
            sped up the marble to fast and it was uncontrollable. As a team, we managed to get the marble to the point we wanted it
            to get to a total of four times! :)

            This week we learned a lot about Mechanical Engineering. Some stuff we learned is how
            broad of a subject mechanical engineering is, it deals with physics, math, bioengineering, material science, 
            and much more. We also learned about some safety rules that we have to follow in class, such as keeping long 
            hair tied up when working on things and also to be responsible with knives when we're using them. Today, we 
            took a quiz on the engineering process as well as the information about safety, I think I did really well on 
            that. We also got to do an engineering challenge which was to CAD a home appliance that we can find around 
            almost every house.
