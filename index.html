            This week we did a lot of setting up our website and now we're actually coding! I coded in html a long time 
            ago and this has been a good refresher. We also learned some safety as well as the engineering process. Today 
            specifically, we got to do a challenge where we had to take a marble from one point to another without it dropping on 
            the floor, the only problem was that we didn't have enough track. So, our team came up with the plan that right after 
            the marble traveled off our track, we'd run to the other end and give it to a person without a piece of track. We found
            that that strategy worked quite well, but we needed practice with it because people were holding it too steep and it
            sped up the marble to fast and it was uncontrollable. As a team, we managed to get the marble to the point we wanted it
            to get to a total of four times! :)

            This week we learned a lot about Mechanical Engineering. Some stuff we learned is how
            broad of a subject mechanical engineering is, it deals with physics, math, bioengineering, material science, 
            and much more. We also learned about some safety rules that we have to follow in class, such as keeping long 
            hair tied up when working on things and also to be responsible with knives when we're using them. Today, we 
            took a quiz on the engineering process as well as the information about safety, I think I did really well on 
            that. We also got to do an engineering challenge which was to CAD a home appliance that we can find around 
            almost every house.

            This week we finalized our Rube Goldberg machine and started to build our contraption. At first, we built it
            way out of proportion making it very small, but after a while we got it to be the correct size in tinker cad.
            Today Keira and I put the piece measurments from the tinker cad onto a piece of paper so we knew exactly what
            to build and we didn't have to go back and double check the measurments. Once we were done with that, Keira and
            I handed over the measurments to Diego and Dickson to cut into final pieces. Diego did the cutting but Dickson
            was just playing with the baseball. We got seven pieces cut today which ticks off one bullet point on our list
            of things to cut.

            This week we finished cutting everything out of the cardboard. Every piece was cut in a day and it was very fun
            to do. Once we had cut everything, we taped it all together and periodically checked if it worked with the ball
            rolling through it. We got it all together and we tried it without the balloon and it worked! Then, after waiting
            for a long time to get a balloon, a pin, and the car and baseball, we tried it out in the first test of it ever.
            The first time that we did it, it did not pop the balloon but we made some repairs to try it out again. After the
            repairs we tried it out again, and this time, it popped the balloon!! I had to cut some off of the end because I 
            got too excited and made the camera go crazy. :P

        <p><br>
            This week we did two engineering challenges that were both really
            fun. The first was we had to make a boat out of one piece of 
            8 1/2" x 11" paper using only scissors and tape. I eneded up making
            what looked like a box and it stayed afloat with 24g on it for
            the full 5 minutes. The second was we had to write the measurments
            down for a uppercase, bubble letter E. The one that I got was not
            very good and only had four measurements on it so it didn't come out
            looking like an actual E. On Thursday we took notes on Computer Engineering
            and learned how it was a mix of computer science and electrical engineering.

            On Monday we learned more about Computer Engineering and what it
            entails. On Tuesday, we got to dissect a computer and see what
            everything looks like physically. Once we dissected it, we put
            everything back into the place it's supposed to be in and then
            we plugged it into power to see if it would turn on. After a
            couple seconds, it turned back on! Today, Thursday, we got to
            color the parts of a computer and the turn it into google
            classroom. We also took a test on Computer Engineering which
            I think I did very well on.

            On Monday we went over biomechanical engineering as a class. On 
            Tuesday, we built a prosthetic hand out of cardboard, string, and tape 
            Keira and I's design worked very well thanks to the tape on the end of
            the fingers. Today we started to fill out a worksheet for the slides
            and we also did our engineering challenge. Mine was a prosthetic leg 
            for a Puffin, which is my favorite animal. I think it turned out quite 
            well. (:

            On Monday, we took a quiz on Bioengineering and learned a lot about
            Aerospace Engineering which is what I want to do with my future.
            I think that it is very fun getting to desing rockets and spacecrafts
            that get to go into space and maybe even out of our solar system. On
            Thursday, we got to TinkerCad out our designs for the rocket that we
            are going to build. Mine is a pretty standard rocket with tilted vertical
            stabilizers to give the rocket some spin. Lastly, I figured out how I can
            can make the height of my nosecone for my rocket!! (the diameter is hard)
            I found that the radius of the circle that I make the cone out of is the 
            slant height and I can use that to find the actual height.

        <p>
            This week we built our design on Tuesday and the building process
            went pretty well for me and Eric, but I forgot to make the vertical
            stabilizers tilted. Today, Thursday, we got to launch our rockets
            and see how far they would go! We decided to go with a good amount
            of water based off of the other teams that went before us, then we
            thought that the highest psi we could do would be the best, that was
            75psi. As you can see in the video, it started to spin almost immediately
            and didn't go as straight as we would've liked. I think that was because
            some of the vertical stabilizers were a little tilted from something which
            might have messed up the aerodynamics of the craft. Another possible cause
            could be that when released, it was pulled to a side and that's what
            caused the spin to happen. Overall, it was just a really fun activity
            and I really liked every aspect of it.

        <p>
            This week we built a water filter and ours didn't work that well.
            Our solution was having the big rocks on the bottom, cottonballs
            on top of that, sand, and then finally pabbles. This gave a very
            dirty result which we were not that happy with. I think that we 
            could have done the smallest things on the bottom, and work our way
            up to the biggest on the top. For example, the cottonballs on the 
            very bottom, then the sand, then pebbles, and the big rocks on the
            top. I learned that the environmental engineers help reduce noise 
            and light polution along with air polution, which I thought they
            only helped with.

            I want to do in my future. I knew most of the stuff from my Physics
            class that I took last year but it was good review. Right now I am 
            having a lot of fun using TinkerCad's circuit ability. We had to light
            up a bunch of LEDs and I figured out how to do it pretty fast. We will
            be working with tangible circuits next week which I am looking
            forward to.

            This week we turned our designs on TinkerCad into a physical circuit.
            Me and my partner worked very quick and got the first lab done very
            fast. After that, we went on to the second lab and did those pretty 
            quick as well. The fourth lab though, was quite tricky, but it was
            only because the arduino was not working correctly. After we got a 
            working arduino, we did the first part of the fourth lab quickly as 
            well. But then the new arduino was not working, and we found out that
            it was because there was code already in it that we could not
            overwrite for some reason. Hopefully we can figure that out next week
            and get back on our way!

            This week we finished up our electical labs, which were very
            fun. We also started to learn about business engineering which is a 
            blend of engineering with business knowledge to make things as 
            good as possible for the customer. We learned the difference between
            a copyright, which is tangible, and an intellectual property, which is intangible. 
            I also learned about a disturbing fact that Tesla, while deciding 
            what the auto pilot would do when the car is out of contol, elected
            to hit 5 kindergarteners instead of hitting a brick wall; which to me 
            is absolute insanity. Lastly, I also learned that I do a little bit of 
            business engineering when doing robotics, we have a Kanban Board that we 
            use to keep track of what has been done and what needs to be done. We 
            brainstormed today about a product that we can pitch to investors and 
            currently we have three ideas but we don't think that they will be 
            convincing enough to actually get an investor to give us money. We will 
            have to think of more things over Thanksgiving Break.

            This week we decided on our product that we would present to the class 
            called "Scrub Doggy". It's a high tech two in one scrubber and toothbrush
            for your fluffy friend. We made all of the slides on Monday and perfected
            them on Tuesday right before we presented. We got a few questions but we
            could answer them with confidence. My favorite pitch was the pitch for the 
            prize trash can because it helps the environment while also giving people 
            a reason to go out of their way to throw away trash. We also took our Business Engineering
            Quiz today and I think that I did very well, there was only one question
            that I didn't know the full answer. We are also going to start on Civil
            Engineering today and then start building spaghetti bridges on Monday which
            I am very excited for.

            This week I learned about Chemical Engineering and how it connects 
            to a lot of different types of engineering. Chemical engineering is 
            a lot like Chemists but while chemists work on a small scale, 
            chemical engineers work on getting the reaction on a bigger scale 
            to have enough material to sell. They can also work with oil and gas 
            companies to make the processors to make the oil into gas. Another 
            thing that they can do is work with the environment to make sure that 
            not a lot of harmful materials are escaping into the Earth atmosphere. 
            Today, I made oobleck, and although it was very hard in the beginning, 
            I eventually put enough water in to get it to the right consistency. The 
            most important thing was getting the consistency right, because if you 
            didn't, then it wouldn't behave correctly.
            It behaves like a solid and a liquid pretty much at the same time, and 
            that was mind bending for me.

            This week we started on our projects, which we could choose between 
            a mouse trap car or an arduino car. I decided to do an arduino car 
            and I was put with Levon and Keira. We did some reasearch on how we 
            could control the wheels of the car with code. We also thought that it 
            would be cool to have a ball bearing on the back of our car so that it 
            would keep itself upright. Everything else on our car would be given 
            to us. I did some preliminary coding and when we get our motors and wheels 
            I will put it to the test to see if the code actually works or if I 
            have to tweak something slightly.

        <p>
            I think the design is pretty good and the process is going 
            very well. The circuit design was very easy because of the 
            resources that Ms. Petrosian gave to us. I got some code working 
            and now one of the two wheels is driving, I think I messed up 
            some inputs in the code so the second is not driving yet. Another 
            thing besides the code that could be affecting it is not having 
            enough voltage to run both at the same time. This week we hope to 
            get the body of the car done and start attaching things to the board 
            so that we can get all of the wires done and taped down. I might also 
            start on integrating the ultrasonic sensor into the code so we can 
            figure out how far our car is from objects, although that will only 
            happen once I get the car driving.

            This week we worked on our code a lot and got both motors running. 
            The reason why both motors weren't running when they should was 
            becase the Arduino didn't have the amperage needed to run both 
            motors at once, so as soon as we added the battery everything 
            started working. We got the two motors following a set path that we 
            had planned out in the code which was very relieving. We also cut 
            out the body for our car and checked that everything fit, which it 
            did!! Next week we plan on mounting everything and testing out our 
            code to make sure that it works. We might also try out the ultrasonic 
            sensor as well.

            This week we mounted everything onto the car body and made sure all 
            of the wiring is correct. After this we could test all of our code 
            and make sure that it will go forward and make it turn when we want 
            it to. As you can see in the video, we got it to go forward and then 
            turn to the left which was a huge success. After this we delved into 
            the ultrasonic sensor, using another breadboard it was easy to connect 
            to the rest of the robot and the code was relatively simple. Today we 
            tried to get the robot moving with the ultrasonic sensor attached but 
            we made the range of it way too close so it would sense the wall but not 
            turn in time. We've upped it from 15cm to 100cm so that it will be able 
            to sense the wall and turn in time.

            This week we did a lot of testing to make sure that our code works 
            and we noticed that sometimes it just spins in a circle forever. 
            After learning this we looked on the internet for a way to get it 
            to stop if it has been turning for more than 5 seconds. We searched 
            and searched and finally found out that you can't do what we were 
            trying to do, which is pretty weird. After that we cleaned up a lot 
            of our code and tested it again. It took a while but we have the car 
            up and running again!

            On Tuesday I tried to look again for a way to stop the car after 
            its been turning for more than 5 seconds but couldn't find anything 
            and gave up on it ):. Today we tested our car in the cafeteria and 
            it worked just the way we wanted it to. It went straight until it got 
            within a meter of something and it turned left to avoid it! The only 
            downside is that it cannot see anything short so it will run into it 
            without detecting it. We were the only group that got the ultrasonic 
            sensor working which I think is pretty cool.

            This week I reasearched for an egg drop that we're going to do in 
            class. I found that putting something underneath the egg to take the 
            impact was a great way to go. When we split out into our groups, I found 
            that my partner also thought that this was a good idea, so we went 
            with a design that had an airbag esc thing underneath a pyramid we're 
            building to hold the egg. We cut out all of the pieces for the air bag 
            and started attaching some of them together. We also did a wheels and 
            doors challenge, my team was doors. We argued that a door is anything 
            that rotates on an axis that gains access to something when it opens. 
            That would include doors, chromebooks, mouths, eyes, etc. We found that 
            on CV property, there were 22,000 doors-ish.
